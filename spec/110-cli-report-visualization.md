# CLI Report Visualization

Example human-readable output for each command in [100-cli-reference.md](100-cli-reference.md).

These are illustrations of intent, not a formatting contract. The first pass is scriptable
only: every command that reports also supports `--json`, which is not shown here. Interactive
mode is deferred (see [020-goals-non-goals.md](020-goals-non-goals.md#non-goals-v1)).

All examples use one running scenario:

- Task `is-prime`, with the three measurements from
  [085-experiment-results.md](085-experiment-results.md#how-a-measures-values-combine):
  `isPrimeTsExists` (`rate`), `tsIgnoreCount` (`mean`, `max`) and `isPrimeTemplateTest` (`sum`).
- Experiment `is-prime-baseline`: a matrix of two models (`haiku`, `sonnet`) with every other
  parameter fixed, so two permutations, five iterations each, ten container runs.

## `init`

```
$ thunderjar init
Created thunderjar/
  experiments/
  experiment-parameters/
    base-image/
    code-state/
    prompt-set/
    harness/
    model/
    initial-prompt/
  tasks/
  _generated/

Next: add an experiment, then run `thunderjar plan <experiment>`.
```

## `generate`

```
$ thunderjar generate

## `plan`

```
$ thunderjar plan is-prime-baseline

```

A floating parameter (one that follows a moving target) shows what it resolved to, so the
hash is explained:

```
  codeState      main @ 3c1d9e2 (floating, resolved now)
```

## `run`

```
$ thunderjar run is-prime-baseline

## `show`

### An execution

One aggregation result per permutation.

```
$ thunderjar show 01K4X9J2E8MQZ3V7R5T0WABCDE

An experiment name stands for its latest execution:

```
$ thunderjar show is-prime-baseline
Execution   01K5A2B7C9D4F6G8H0JKMNPQRS  (latest of is-prime-baseline)
...
```

Where a measure's stored value is stale (its content hash no longer matches the measurement),
it is marked rather than hidden:

```
  isPrimeTemplateTest  4/5       sum {passed: 17, failed: 3}  stale, run `remeasure`
```

## `compare`

Compares aggregation results. How they are matched up depends on whether the permutation
hashes agree, which is the open question in
[085-experiment-results.md](085-experiment-results.md#open-questions).

### Same permutation hashes

Each permutation in A is paired with the one in B of the same hash. This is the clean case:
the same experiment, run twice, such as a weekly rerun.

```
$ thunderjar compare 01K4X9J2E8MQZ3V7R5T0WABCDE 01K5A2B7C9D4F6G8H0JKMNPQRS
A  01K4X9J2E8MQZ3V7R5T0WABCDE  2026-09-29  is-prime-baseline
B  01K5A2B7C9D4F6G8H0JKMNPQRS  2026-10-02  is-prime-baseline
All 2 permutations match by hash. Measurement sets match.

Permutation 4f9a21c8  model=haiku
  MEASURE              A                 B                 CHANGE
  isPrimeTsExists      rate 0.80         rate 0.40         -0.40  worse
  tsIgnoreCount        mean 0.6, max 2   mean 1.4, max 3   +0.8   worse
  isPrimeTemplateTest  sum 17/3          sum 15/5          -2     worse
  cost / iteration     $0.022            $0.021            -$0.001
  duration (mean)      0:43              0:44              +0:01

Permutation 9be07d35  model=sonnet
  MEASURE              A                 B                 CHANGE
  isPrimeTsExists      rate 1.00         rate 1.00         =
  tsIgnoreCount        mean 0.0, max 0   mean 0.0, max 0   =
  isPrimeTemplateTest  sum 24/1          sum 25/0          +1     better
  cost / iteration     $0.117            $0.121            +$0.004
  duration (mean)      1:03              1:05              +0:02
```

With 5 iterations, a rate moving by 0.2 is one iteration. The CHANGE column is a difference, not a
significance test.

### Different permutation hashes

When a parameter changed (here, the prompt set), hashes differ and there is nothing to pair
by. The output says which parameters differ, and compares only what has the same shape:
measurements where name and content hash both match.

```
$ thunderjar compare 01K4X9J2E8MQZ3V7R5T0WABCDE 01K6C4D8F0H2K4M6P8RTVWXYZ1
A  01K4X9J2E8MQZ3V7R5T0WABCDE  2026-09-29  is-prime-baseline
B  01K6C4D8F0H2K4M6P8RTVWXYZ1  2026-10-02  is-prime-snerk-v2
No permutation hashes match.

Parameters that differ
  promptSet  snerk (c7d4)  ->  snerk (91ab)   same name, different content
  model      haiku, sonnet -> haiku, sonnet   same

Pairing permutations by the parameters that did not change:
  A 4f9a21c8  <->  B 7d20e6b4   model=haiku
  A 9be07d35  <->  B 02c8f7a1   model=sonnet

Measurement sets differ. Comparing 2 of 3 measurements.
  isPrimeTemplateTest   A: d91f6a07   B: 5e3c8b12   not comparable (version differs)

Pair model=haiku
  MEASURE          A                 B                 CHANGE
  isPrimeTsExists  rate 0.80         rate 0.80         =
  tsIgnoreCount    mean 0.6, max 2   mean 0.2, max 1   -0.4   better
  cost / iteration $0.022            $0.019            -$0.003

Pair model=sonnet
  ...
```

Run `thunderjar remeasure <execution>` first to give both executions the same measures; that is
what makes a comparison like the one above complete.

## `remeasure`

### An execution

```
$ thunderjar remeasure 01K4X9J2E8MQZ3V7R5T0WABCDE
Execution 01K4X9J2E8MQZ3V7R5T0WABCDE  (10 container runs)
Current measurements for task is-prime:
  isPrimeTsExists      up to date
  tsIgnoreCount        up to date
  isPrimeTemplateTest  new / changed (d91f6a07)

Measuring in new measurement containers from each postrun image:
  4f9a21c8 i00  isPrimeTemplateTest  {passed: 4, failed: 1}
  4f9a21c8 i01  isPrimeTemplateTest  {passed: 5, failed: 0}
  4f9a21c8 i02  isPrimeTemplateTest  {passed: 5, failed: 0}
  4f9a21c8 i03  isPrimeTemplateTest  skipped
  4f9a21c8 i04  isPrimeTemplateTest  {passed: 3, failed: 2}
  ...

Updated 10 container runs. Recomputed 2 aggregation results.
The agent was not rerun.
```

### An experiment

```
$ thunderjar remeasure is-prime-baseline
is-prime-baseline has 3 executions (20 container runs)
  01K4S3M8T1V6Y0Z2B4D7FGHJKL  10 runs  2026-09-22
  01K4X9J2E8MQZ3V7R5T0WABCDE  10 runs  2026-09-29
  01K5A2B7C9D4F6G8H0JKMNPQRS  10 runs  2026-10-02  (already current, nothing to do)

Measuring 20 container runs...  done
Updated 20 container runs. Recomputed 4 aggregation results.
```

A measurement that was deleted from the task is not removed from past runs. Its measures are
kept and excluded from aggregation results:

```
  tsIgnoreCount  deleted from task; 10 stored measures kept, excluded from aggregates
```

## `restore`

Run from inside a git repository.

```
$ cd ~/git-workspace/my-project
$ thunderjar restore postrun-e01K4X9J2E8MQZ3V7R5T0WABCDE-h4f9a21c8-i03
Fetched 3 commits from postrun-e01K4X9J2E8MQZ3V7R5T0WABCDE-h4f9a21c8-i03

When the end state was already fully committed, the Thunderjar commit line is omitted.

```

## Open questions

- **Pairing permutations in `compare`** when hashes differ. The example above pairs by the
  parameters that did not change. That is one proposal, not a decision.
- **Judging "better" and "worse".** Whether a measurement needs a declared direction (higher is
  better, lower is better) for `compare` to say so. The examples assume it does.
- **Noise.** Whether `compare` shows any spread or significance across iterations, or only the
  aggregate values.
- **Terminal width.** How the tables degrade in narrow terminals and when many permutations are
  shown.

## Verification

Most of this page is design illustration; only the git and image-name claims are checkable.

- **Branch name** `thunderjar/postrun-e01K…-i03` is a valid git ref: `git check-ref-format --branch` accepts it (git docs: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-check-ref-format).
- **Contradicted:** the container-run / image name `postrun-e01K4X9J2E8MQZ3V7R5T0WABCDE-h4f9a21c8-i03` contains uppercase letters (the ULID). Docker image references allow only lowercase `[a-z0-9]` in path components ([distribution/reference grammar](https://github.com/distribution/reference/blob/main/reference.go)), so it is not a valid image name as written. Not rewritten here; the naming scheme is owned by another page and needs a lowercase ULID (or similar).
- Demo: [`scratchpad/verification/110-restore-names/`](../scratchpad/verification/110-restore-names/test.sh) (`output.txt`). Docker daemon not available; grammar checked by regex, not by `docker tag`.
- Unverified: all output formats and numbers (illustrative by design).
