# Harness

A named, version-pinned definition of an agent tool. The harness is the only parameter
involved in all three phases of a container run: it is installed into the image,
invoked to do the work, and read back afterwards for what the run cost.

One of the six experiment parameters. Hashing and `applyParameter` are common to all of
them — see [060-experiment-parameters.md](060-experiment-parameters.md).

## Declaration

Lives at `experiment-parameters/harnesses/<name>/index.ts`.

```ts
// experiment-parameters/harnesses/claude-code-2-1-283/index.ts
const version = "2.1.283";

export default declareHarness({
  version,

  // build: layer the tool into the prerun image
  applyParameter: () =>
    `COPY --from=thunderjar/harness-claude-code:${version} /opt/claude /opt/claude`,

  // run: execute the agent, and write the result file
  cli: (ctx) =>
    `claude -p "${ctx.initialPrompt}" --model ${ctx.modelId} ` +
    `--allowedTools "Write,Edit,Read,Bash" --output-format json > ${ctx.resultPath}`,

  // interpret: turn that file's contents into normalised token costs
  collectTokenCosts: (raw) => { /* … */ },

  // env vars the agent needs at run time; the user supplies the values
  requiredEnv: ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"],

  // which models this harness runs, and the ID it passes for each
  models: {
    "sonnet-5-5": "claude-sonnet-5-5",
    "haiku-4-5": "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001",
  },
});
```

| Field | Phase | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | — | The pinned version of the agent tool. |
| `applyParameter` | Build | Returns the Dockerfile fragment that installs the tool. |
| `cli` | Run | Returns the command that runs the agent. |
| `collectTokenCosts` | Interpret | Turns the result file into normalised token costs. |
| `requiredEnv` | Run | Names of the environment variables the agent needs, e.g. its API key. |
| `models` | Run | Which models this harness runs, and the ID it passes for each. |

## `applyParameter`: installing the tool

The fragment layers the agent tool into the prerun image. The example copies it from a
pre-built harness image. A declaration is free to `RUN npm install` instead.

Where the pre-built harness images come from is unresolved — see
[020-goals-non-goals.md](020-goals-non-goals.md#to-revisit).

## `cli`: running the agent

`cli` receives a context and returns the command to run:

| Context field | What it is |
|---|---|
| `ctx.initialPrompt` | The experiment's [initial prompt](066-task.md#initial-prompts). |
| `ctx.modelId` | The ID this harness passes for the permutation's model — see [`models`](#models-which-models-it-runs). |
| `ctx.resultPath` | Where the command must write its result file. |

`cli` carries a contract: **the command it returns must both run the agent and leave a
file at `ctx.resultPath`.** Thunderjar supplies the path and never parses the file
itself. It hands the bytes to that same harness's `collectTokenCosts`.

Thunderjar also wraps the command to record start time, finish time and exit code. The
harness author does nothing for that — see
[080-docker-execution.md](080-docker-execution.md#the-execution-wrapper).

## `collectTokenCosts`: reading back the cost

Receives the raw contents of the result file and returns normalised token costs. See
[087-collecting-token-costs.md](087-collecting-token-costs.md) for the `TokenCosts`
contract and what happens when the file is missing or malformed.

## `requiredEnv`: credentials

The harness declares the names of the environment variables its agent needs. The user
exports them in the shell (or CI secret store) that runs Thunderjar, and Thunderjar
passes exactly those names into that harness's containers, through a mounted file that
the execution wrapper loads. Never as `docker run -e`, which `docker commit` would
preserve in the postrun image. See
[082-keeping-secrets-secret.md](082-keeping-secrets-secret.md).

- **Names only.** Values never appear in the declaration, the image config or layers, the
  run data store or any hash. They exist only in the harness process's environment at run
  time.
- **Not written to disk by the tool.** `cli` must invoke the tool so that it reads its
  credentials from the environment and does not persist them, since the postrun image
  keeps whatever the tool wrote. See
  [082-keeping-secrets-secret.md](082-keeping-secrets-secret.md#the-harness-must-not-persist-credentials).
- **Scoped to the harness.** A container sees only its own harness's variables, so a run
  of one harness never receives another's key.
- **Fails fast.** `plan` and `run` stop before building anything if a required variable
  is unset, naming the variable and the harness that asked for it.
- **Hashed by name.** `requiredEnv` is part of the harness's parameter hash: changing
  what a harness needs is a change to the harness.

A harness whose needed variables depend on the model's provider (Claude Code on Bedrock
needs AWS variables, not `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) is not handled in v1. Declare one harness
per provider for now.

## `models`: which models it runs

`models` is the only place that says which models a harness can run. Each key is a
[model](065-model.md) folder name under `experiment-parameters/models/`, and its value
is the ID this harness passes for that model, as `ctx.modelId`.

Different harnesses spell the same model differently:

```ts
// experiment-parameters/harnesses/opencode-1-4-0/index.ts
  models: {
    "sonnet-5-5": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5-5",
    "gpt-5": "openai/gpt-5",
  },
```

An experiment listing a model that one of its harnesses can't run is a type error — see
[055-declaring-experiments.md](055-declaring-experiments.md#harness-and-model-must-be-compatible).

### Hashing

`models` is excluded from the harness's parameter hash. The resolved model ID goes into
the permutation's permutation hash instead.

For `claude-code-2-1-283` with `sonnet-5-5`, the permutation hash includes:

```
harness parameter hash     (everything in the folder except `models`)
model parameter hash       (sonnet-5-5)
resolved model ID        "claude-sonnet-5-5"
…the other four parameters' parameter hashes
```

| Change | Effect on existing permutation hashes |
|---|---|
| Add a model to `models` | None. |
| Change one model's ID | Only that model's permutations change. |
| Change `cli` or `version` | Every permutation using this harness changes. |

> **Future:** the mapping may move to a separate file in the harness folder, excluded
> from hashing by location rather than by field.

## Comparing versions of a tool

Comparing two versions of the same tool (Claude Code 2.1.283 against 2.2.0) is
comparing two harness declarations with different pinned versions. It is not a special
case. This is why harness stays separate from base image rather than being folded into
it.

## Accepted tradeoffs

- **`collectTokenCosts` is part of the harness's parameter hash, though it doesn't
  determine what runs.** Strictly it belongs with measurements — it interprets a run
  after the fact. Because the declaration folder is hashed, correcting a parser bug
  changes the harness's parameter hash, and so the permutation hash, marking old runs as not
  directly comparable even though nothing about what executed changed. Accepted for
  now: keeping the harness's three phases in one declaration is worth more than the
  hash precision, and a hash change is a warning rather than an error. Token costs stay
  re-derivable regardless, since the raw result file is preserved in the postrun image.
